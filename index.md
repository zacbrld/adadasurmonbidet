## INTRODUCTION

When Tarantino makes his films, you might imagine that he starts with the most obvious choices: the genre of the film, the plot that will unfold, or the scenes that will surprise us. But among these big decisions, there's another, more subtle, but just as crucial: choosing the characters' first names. Bill, Rick, Django... how does he make his choice? Is it really a matter of chance, or does each name conceal a clue to the character's identity?  
Take the name “Jacky”’: do you imagine a rebellious teenager, an adorable Canadian grandmother, or a “badass” woman? It's interesting to note that some first names make us think of certain stereotypes or specific character traits. But what do these names reveal about the characters themselves? In the universe of cinema, each first name can have a considerable impact on the way we perceive a character.  
If you watch a series of romantic comedies, you may well start to notice a number of recurring first names. What is hiding behind these repetitions? Are these first names simply practical or do they allow us to deduce the personality of the characters they refer to?

So, beyond first impressions, the association of first names with character traits may in fact be much more relevant than we think. Through a number of qualitative and syntactic characteristics, we aim to show that there is no such thing as chance when choosing a first name for a film in the cinema! If I told you that Tarantino's next character had your first name, what would its attributes be? It's up to you to find out.
